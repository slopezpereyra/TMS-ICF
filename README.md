Automated intra-cortical facilitation/inhibition data analysis. Includes random forest ML model with AdaBoost enhancement for pulse-specific, relative-amplitude-based classification, as well as low-resolution typical ISI vs. facilitation plots.

Data collected via TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) at the *Laboratory for the Study of Sleep Slow-wave activity*.
